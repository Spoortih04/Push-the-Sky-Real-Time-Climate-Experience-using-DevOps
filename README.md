This project focuses on the design and deployment of a weather web application that provides real-time weather information based on user input. Built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), 
the application fetches live data from the WeatherAPI and displays it in a clean, user-friendly interface.To streamline development and ensure continuous delivery, the project integrates GitHub for version control 
and GitHub Actions for automating the CI/CD pipeline. Every time code is pushed to the repository, the workflow automatically builds and deploys the latest version of the app to Azure Static Web Apps, ensuring fast 
and reliable updates with minimal manual effort.This solution eliminates traditional deployment overhead, improves scalability through cloud hosting, and demonstrates an efficient full-stack workflow using modern 
DevOps practices. The architecture supports future enhancements such as geolocation-based search, Progressive Web App (PWA) support, multilingual accessibility, and secure API key management via GitHub Secrets or 
Azure Key Vault.
